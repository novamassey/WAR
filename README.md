##**WAR** Card Game
>**War** is played by dividing a shuffled deck of cards equally amongst two players.  Each player flips their top card, the player with the higher value card wins and collects both played cards.  If the value of the cards is equal then you have entered **WAR** and each player deals a card face down followed by a card face up and the player with the higher value wins all cards in the play.
